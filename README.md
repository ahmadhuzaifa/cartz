# Cartz
Cartz is a consumer software startup that connects neighbors willing to coordinate deliveries and errands in an organized and systematic manner. This process is done through a mobile application, where users can request and deliver items to other users within a 10-mile vicinity of their location. Users obtain credit for completing deliveries through the application, which then can be redeemed for gift cards.
